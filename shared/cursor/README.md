Mouse Cursor
============

This is the mouse cursor image used in BuffyBox applications. The bitmap is adapted from Ubuntu's [Yaru] theme suite. Similar to fonts, the cursor image needs to be converted to LVGL-compatible C code before it can be used. Therefore, after any change to `cursor.png`, run `regenerate.sh` to recreate `cursor.c`.
